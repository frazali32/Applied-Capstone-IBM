Tim Hortons Inc. is a fast food restaurant chain, specializing in coffee, doughnuts, and other fast food items. It is Canada's largest quick service restaurant chain; as of December 31, 2018, it had a total of 4,846 restaurants in 14 countries. The company has its headquarters in Toronto. Since it is an established brand, Many entrepreneurs seek to open their own their own chain.

The required capital to open your own store ranges from __$60,000__ to __600,000__ so it is of investor's best interest to find the best location to generate highest profits. In this project, I will use a trade area analysis named __thiessen polygons__ to determine potential new spots within the areas of Etobicoke, York, West Toronto and Central Toronto. This will help any investor looking to open Tim Hortons in these boroughs.

__Data:__

We will use the following wikipedia page to gather PostalCodes, Boroughs and Neighborhoods: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M

This will give us all required boroughs in Toronto and their neighborhoods.

We will also need geographical coordinates for every neighborhood. The following link will be used:

Coordinates wil be used to collect nearby venues given radius using __Foursquare API__.
